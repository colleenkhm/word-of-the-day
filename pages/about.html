    <div class="community guidelines">
        <p>this is an app designed to inspire creativity and thoughtfulness. each day at midnight a new random word will be generated to serve as a prompt for you to engage with in whatever way sparks your interest. it can be used as a journal, a social media app, a portfolio, or all three! feel free to keep your content to yourself, share with your friends, or post it for all community members to admire :)</p>
        <h5>please</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>keep comments positive. art is subjective, and if there is something that doesn't spark your interest, feel free to not engage with it. not everything is for everyone and that in itself is a part of what makes art so beautiful!</li>
            <li>no hate speech. content and comments rooted in hate or prejudice towards certain communities of people or toward specific named people will be removed immediately. i recognize that art is often fueled by intense emotion, and i am not asking that you avoid leaning into that emotion, but if your content is about someone specific that person's anonymity must be preserved for your content to be acceptable to post publicly.</li>
            <li>acknowledge the creator. you are more than welcome to post something the prompt reminds you of that is not your own, such as a quote or lyric, but please clarify that it is not your original content and give credit to the individual or group of individuals who created it!</li>
        </ul>
